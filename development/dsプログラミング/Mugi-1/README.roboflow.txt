The dataset includes 705 images.
Reef are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels
